## Architectural Decision Record \(ADR\)

This is a collection of decisions that have been made for BCC Media projects.

Each document describes one decision and reflects what the pros and cons are, what other solutions were considered, as well as any additional background for the decision.

More about it [here](https://cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions)

### Tools
